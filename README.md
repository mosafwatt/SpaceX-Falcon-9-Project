# SpaceX-Falcon-9-Project
##Overview
In this project, the goal is to predict whether SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will land successfully, helping you estimate the cost of each launch. The project involves using APIs, data wrangling, SQL, data analysis, and machine learning. 

## Contents
- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- **Data**: Raw and processed datasets used in the analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Plots and charts generated during the analysis.
- **Models**: Machine learning models developed for predicting launch success.

## Objectives
1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Matplotlib.
2. Visualize relationships between launch variables and success rates.
3. Implement machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN) to predict launch success.
4. Optimize model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
